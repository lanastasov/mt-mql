  Description: It is a TREND pattern in which wave 3 is extended. This is the most probable trend pattern. Very often wave 1 is equal to wave 5 in time and price when the third wave is extended. Often an extension is preceded by an expanded flat or truncation in wave C;

Pattern:Extension5
{
  Type:Trend;
  Probability:0.700;
  Description: It is a TREND pattern in which wave 5 is extended. If waves 1 and 3 are more or less equal in length an extended wave 5 can be expected. Often an extension is preceded by expanded flat in wave 4 or truncation in the previous wave C. Mostly, wave 3 is extended, although Elliott himself expected the fifth wave to extend. The extended wave 5 is often equal to the price distance of the beginning of wave 1 to the end of wave 3. As soon as extension in wave 5 is complete, it will retrace swiftly to the previous wave 2;

  Description: It is a TREND pattern in which waves 4 and 1 are crossed and all waves have a CORRECTIVE internal structure. Its appearance is usual to wave 5 or wave C and not allowed in wave 3. A strong and swift reversal usually follows when wave A reaches the area of wave 2 of the diagonal;

  Description: It is a TREND pattern in which the waves 4 and 1 are crossed, but all waves 1-3-5 have a TREND internal structure. Its appearance is usual in the trend in waves 1 or 5 and in the corrective waves A or C, some Expert Advisors admits this pattern only in wave 1 or wave A. Usually after that a strong reversal follows;

  Description: It is a TREND pattern in which wave 4 retraces the maximum 62% without crossing wave 1. A strict interpretation of Elliott Waves says that wave 4 cannot retrace more than 50%, but it often happens in extreme market situations or in intraday charts. Its appearance is rare and possible only in trend wave 1 or 5 or in the corrective wave A or C;

  Description: It is a TREND pattern in which the fifth wave fails to exceed the end of wave 3. It occurs rare, wave 4 may still be in progress or only the first subwave of wave 5 is complete. Then usually the strong reversal follows;

  Description: It is a sharp CORRECTIVE pattern in which 2 Zigzags are connected with wave X which doesn't retrace more than 61.8% of wave A, B and C taken altogether. It is a popular corrective pattern; It is very similar to the impulse and contains 7 waves! Waves X are mostly zigzags too;

  Description: It is a sharp CORRECTIVE pattern in which 3 zigzags are connected with waves X which don't retrace more than 61.8% of wave A, B and C taken altogether. It is unpopular corrective pattern; It is very similar to the impulse and contains 11 waves! Waves X are mostly zigzags too;

  Description: This pattern is defined as a complex CORRECTIVE pattern in which each wave itself is a corrective wave. The first X-wave must retrace more than 61.8% to qualify as WXYXZ. It is a less popular corrective pattern which can take a form of a flat or a sharp correction;

  Description: This is a complex CORRECTIVE pattern in which waves A and B are corrective, but wave C is a TREND pattern, besides, wave B approaches the beginning of wave A. It is a very popular corrective pattern which takes a form of a flat correction;  Wave B itself almost never becomes a flat;

  Description: This pattern is a special running flat where wave C fails to exceed the end of wave A, but retraces more than 60%. If it retraces more than 60%, this is a very probable pattern, because in this case the correction usually terminates on the last minimum;

  Description: This is a complex CORRECTIVE pattern in which all waves are corrective and the trend lines converge. It is a very popular corrective pattern which takes a form of a flat correction;  Triangles mostly occur in wave 4 or wave B, sometimes in wave X. This is followed by a strong movement. As wave  terminated, the price makes a strong movement to the trend side in the minimum value equal to the widest part of the triangle ;

  Description: This is a complex CORRECTIVE pattern in which all waves are corrective and the trend lines converge. It is a very popular corrective pattern which takes a form of a flat correction;  Triangles mostly occur in wave 4 or wave B, sometimes in wave X. These will be followed by a swift reversal;

  Description: This pattern is defines as a complex CORRECTIVE pattern in which all waves are CORRECTIVE and the trend lines diverge. It is a very rare pattern which takes a form of a flat correction. Triangles are mostly occur in wave 4 or wave B, sometimes in wave X. These will be followed by a swift reversal;

  Description: This is a complex CORRECTIVE pattern in which all the waves are corrective and trend lines converge, besides wave B exceeds the beginning of wave A. It is a less popular corrective pattern which takes a form of a flat correction;  Triangles are mostly occur in wave 4 or wave B, sometimes in wave X. These will be followed by a swift reversal;
